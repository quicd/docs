description: Comprehensive glossary of QUIC and QuicD terminology
---

Complete reference of terms used throughout the QuicD documentation. Includes QUIC protocol concepts, QuicD-specific terminology, and general networking terms.

## QUIC Protocol Terms

### ACK (Acknowledgment)

A frame sent by a receiver to inform the sender which packets have been successfully received. QUIC ACKs are sent on a per-packet-number-space basis and include ranges of acknowledged packet numbers.

**Related**: ACK Delay, Max ACK Delay

### ACK Delay

The time between when a packet is received and when the corresponding ACK is sent. QUIC allows tuning this delay to batch ACKs and reduce overhead.

**Configuration**: `max_ack_delay` in QUIC config

### Active Connection ID

A Connection ID that is currently in use for a connection. QUIC allows multiple Connection IDs per connection to support connection migration.

**See also**: Connection Migration

### ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation)

TLS extension that allows the client and server to negotiate which application protocol (HTTP/3, custom protocol, etc.) to use during the TLS handshake.

**Example**: `h3` for HTTP/3, `h3-29` for draft-29

### Bidirectional Stream

A stream that allows data to flow in both directions. Either endpoint can send data and both can close their sending side independently.

**API**: `open_bidirectional_stream()`, `accept_bidirectional_stream()`

### CIDS (Connection IDs)

See Connection ID.

### Congestion Control

Algorithm that adjusts the sending rate based on network conditions to avoid overwhelming the network. QUIC supports pluggable congestion control (CUBIC, BBR, etc.).

**Configuration**: `congestion_control` in QUIC config

### Congestion Window (CWND)

The maximum amount of data that can be in flight (sent but not acknowledged) at any given time. Dynamically adjusted by the congestion control algorithm.

**Monitoring**: Available in connection stats

### Connection ID (CID)

A randomly generated identifier for a QUIC connection. QUIC uses Connection IDs to identify connections, allowing migration across network changes (TCP uses 4-tuple: src IP, src port, dst IP, dst port).

**Length**: 0-20 bytes (typically 8-16 bytes)

### Connection Migration

QUIC feature that allows a connection to survive network changes (IP address or port changes) by using Connection IDs instead of the 4-tuple.

**Example**: Mobile device switching from WiFi to cellular

### Crypto Frame

QUIC frame carrying TLS handshake data. Used during connection establishment to perform the TLS 1.3 handshake.

### Datagram

Unreliable, unordered message sent over QUIC. Datagrams don't guarantee delivery or ordering but have lower latency than streams.

**Use case**: Gaming, VoIP, real-time data

**API**: `send_datagram()`, `AppEvent::DatagramReceived`

### Flow Control

Mechanism to prevent a sender from overwhelming a receiver with data. QUIC has flow control at both stream and connection levels.

**Types**: 
- Stream flow control: Per-stream limits
- Connection flow control: Aggregate limit across all streams

**Configuration**: `initial_max_data`, `initial_max_stream_data_*`

### Frame

The basic unit of QUIC communication. Packets contain one or more frames. Frame types include STREAM, ACK, CRYPTO, RESET_STREAM, etc.

**Examples**: STREAM frame (carries stream data), ACK frame (acknowledges packets)

### Handshake

The process of establishing a QUIC connection, including TLS 1.3 handshake, connection parameter exchange, and initial key establishment.

**Phases**: Initial, Handshake, Application Data

**Latency**: Typically 1-RTT, 0-RTT possible with resumption

### HTTP/3

Major revision of HTTP protocol that uses QUIC instead of TCP. Combines features of HTTP/2 (multiplexing, server push) with QUIC's benefits (0-RTT, improved loss recovery, connection migration).

**ALPN**: `h3`

**QuicD support**: Via `quicd-h3` crate

### Initial Keys

Cryptographic keys used to protect the first packets of a QUIC connection. Derived deterministically from the connection ID.

### Initial Packet

The first packet type in a QUIC connection, protected with Initial Keys. Contains CRYPTO frames with the client's TLS ClientHello.

### Loss Detection

Process of determining when packets have been lost and need retransmission. QUIC uses time-based and ACK-based loss detection.

**Mechanisms**:
- Time threshold: Packet lost if not ACKed within RTT + threshold
- Packet threshold: Lost if 3 subsequent packets are ACKed

### Max Stream Data

Flow control limit for a single stream. Specifies how many bytes can be sent on a stream.

**Configuration**: `initial_max_stream_data_bidi`, `initial_max_stream_data_uni`

### MAX_DATA Frame

Frame that increases the connection-level flow control limit.

### MAX_STREAM_DATA Frame

Frame that increases the stream-level flow control limit.

### NEW_CONNECTION_ID Frame

Frame that provides additional Connection IDs for the peer to use, supporting connection migration.

### 0-RTT (Zero Round-Trip Time)

QUIC feature allowing application data to be sent in the first flight of packets, before the handshake completes. Requires previous connection to the same server.

**Benefits**: Eliminates handshake latency

**Limitations**: Less secure, not all data allowed (must be idempotent)

**API**: Resume tickets, early data

### 1-RTT

Normal handshake mode where application data can be sent after one round trip (client sends Initial, server responds with Handshake).

### Packet

The unit of data sent over UDP. A QUIC packet contains a header and one or more frames. Protected with authenticated encryption.

**Types**: Initial, Handshake, 0-RTT, 1-RTT

### Packet Number

Monotonically increasing number assigned to each packet. Used for ACKs and loss detection. Starts at 0 for each packet number space.

### Packet Number Space

Separate sequence of packet numbers. QUIC has three: Initial, Handshake, and Application Data.

### Path MTU

Maximum Transmission Unit for a network path. QUIC performs Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) to find the maximum packet size that can be sent without fragmentation.

**Default**: 1200 bytes (safe minimum)

**Typical**: 1472 bytes (Ethernet MTU 1500 - IP 20 - UDP 8)

### QPACK

Header compression scheme used by HTTP/3, similar to HTTP/2's HPACK but designed for QUIC's unordered delivery.

**QuicD support**: Implemented in `quicd-h3` crate

### QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)

Modern transport protocol built on UDP, standardized as RFC 9000. Combines features of TCP (reliability, congestion control) with improvements (0-RTT, stream multiplexing, connection migration).

**Developed by**: Google (originally), standardized by IETF

**Version**: QuicD implements QUIC v1 (RFC 9000)

### RESET_STREAM Frame

Frame that abruptly terminates a stream with an error code. Used when the sender wants to stop sending on a stream.

**API**: `SendStream::reset()`

### RTT (Round-Trip Time)

Time for a packet to travel from sender to receiver and back. Used by congestion control and loss detection.

**Monitoring**: Available in connection stats

**Typical**: 10-100ms (local network to internet)

### Server Name Indication (SNI)

TLS extension that allows a client to indicate which hostname it's connecting to, enabling virtual hosting.

**Use case**: Multiple domains on same IP address

### STOP_SENDING Frame

Frame that requests the peer to stop sending data on a stream. Sent by a receiver that no longer wants to receive data.

**API**: `RecvStream::stop()`

### Stream

Ordered, reliable byte stream within a QUIC connection. Multiple streams can be multiplexed over a single connection.

**Types**: Bidirectional, Unidirectional

**Benefits**: Independent streams don't block each other (head-of-line blocking solved)

### Stream Frame

Frame that carries stream data. Contains stream ID, offset, and payload.

### Stream ID

64-bit identifier for a stream. Encoding indicates:
- Bit 0: Initiator (0 = client, 1 = server)
- Bit 1: Direction (0 = bidirectional, 1 = unidirectional)
- Remaining bits: Stream number

**Example**: Stream ID 4 = client-initiated, bidirectional, stream number 1

### Stream Limit

Maximum number of concurrent streams allowed. Separate limits for bidirectional and unidirectional streams.

**Configuration**: `max_streams_bidi`, `max_streams_uni`

### TLS 1.3

Latest version of Transport Layer Security protocol, required by QUIC for encryption and authentication.

**Benefits**: 1-RTT handshake, 0-RTT resumption, modern cipher suites

### Transport Parameters

Connection-level parameters exchanged during the handshake. Includes flow control limits, max stream counts, max idle timeout, etc.

### Unidirectional Stream

Stream that only allows data flow in one direction. The initiator can only send, the peer can only receive.

**Benefits**: Lower overhead than bidirectional

**API**: `open_unidirectional_stream()`, `accept_unidirectional_stream()`

## QuicD-Specific Terms

### App Task

Asynchronous task spawned by a `QuicAppFactory` to handle a single connection. Interacts with QuicD via `ConnectionHandle` and events.

**API**: See [API Reference](/reference/api/)

### eBPF Routing

Performance optimization using eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to route incoming connections to the correct worker thread at the kernel level.

**Benefits**: Reduces cache thrashing, improves locality

**Requirement**: Requires root privileges

### Event Loop

The core loop in each worker thread that processes I/O events from io_uring and dispatches them to appropriate handlers.

**Location**: `worker/mod.rs`

### H3Handler

Trait for implementing HTTP/3 request handlers in the `quicd-h3` crate.

**Method**: `handle_request(request, stream)`

### io_uring

Linux kernel interface for asynchronous I/O. QuicD uses io_uring for zero-copy UDP socket operations.

**Requirements**: Linux kernel 5.1+

**Benefits**: Reduced syscalls, true zero-copy, batch operations

### NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)

Memory architecture in multi-socket systems where memory access time depends on memory location relative to processor. QuicD can allocate memory on the correct NUMA node for best performance.

**Configuration**: `numa_aware` in netio config

### QuicAppFactory

Main trait for creating QUIC applications. Implemented by application developers to handle new connections.

**Method**: `create_app(handle: ConnectionHandle)`

**Pattern**: Factory creates app tasks for each connection

### QuicD

Open-source, high-performance QUIC server implementation written in Rust. Supports HTTP/3, custom protocols, and application-layer multiplexing.

**Pronunciation**: "quick-dee"

### Registry

Central registry mapping protocol names to application factories. Allows running multiple application types in a single QuicD instance.

**Example**: `registry.register("http3", h3_factory)`

### Runtime

The QuicD runtime manages worker threads, task scheduling, and coordination between components.

**Configuration**: `[runtime]` section in config

### Telemetry

Observability features including metrics (Prometheus), logging, and tracing (OpenTelemetry).

**Configuration**: `[telemetry]` section in config

### Worker Thread

OS thread dedicated to handling I/O for a subset of connections. Each worker has its own event loop, io_uring instance, and connection table.

**Benefits**: Lock-free per-worker, CPU cache locality

**Configuration**: `worker_count` in runtime config

### Zero-Copy

Technique where data is transferred without copying between buffers. QuicD achieves zero-copy through io_uring and careful buffer management.

**Benefits**: Reduced CPU usage, higher throughput

## Networking Terms

### BDP (Bandwidth-Delay Product)

The product of a network's bandwidth and its RTT. Represents the amount of data that can be in flight.

**Formula**: BDP = Bandwidth × RTT

**Use**: Determines optimal flow control window size

### Handoff

Process of transferring a packet or connection from one worker thread to another. QuicD minimizes handoffs for performance.

### Head-of-Line Blocking

Problem where one blocked stream delays all others. TCP suffers from this; QUIC solves it with independent streams.

**Example**: In TCP, one lost packet blocks all data. In QUIC, only that stream is blocked.

### Jitter

Variation in packet arrival times. High jitter degrades real-time applications (VoIP, gaming).

### MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)

Maximum packet size that can be sent on a network. Ethernet typical MTU is 1500 bytes.

### NAT (Network Address Translation)

Technique for mapping private IP addresses to public ones. QUIC's Connection IDs help with NAT rebinding.

### Retransmission

Resending data that was lost or not acknowledged. QUIC retransmits data in new packets with new packet numbers.

### Socket

Endpoint for network communication. QuicD uses UDP sockets.

### Throughput

Amount of data transferred per unit time. Measured in bps (bits per second) or Gbps.

### TLS (Transport Layer Security)

Cryptographic protocol for secure communication. QUIC uses TLS 1.3.

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Connectionless transport protocol. QUIC is built on top of UDP.

**Benefits**: No kernel connection state, easier deployment through NATs/firewalls than new IP protocols

## Performance Terms

### Batching

Processing multiple operations together to amortize overhead. QuicD batches packet processing.

**Configuration**: `batch_size` in netio config

### Cache Locality

Keeping data in CPU caches for fast access. CPU affinity and NUMA awareness improve cache locality.

### CPU Affinity

Binding threads to specific CPU cores to improve cache locality.

**Configuration**: `enable_cpu_affinity` in runtime config

### Hot Path

Code path that is executed frequently and is critical for performance. QuicD optimizes hot paths with zero-copy and lock-free data structures.

### Latency

Time delay between when data is sent and when it's received or processed.

**Types**: Network latency (RTT), processing latency

### Lock-Free

Data structure or algorithm that doesn't use locks. QuicD workers are mostly lock-free for performance.

### Multiplexing

Sending multiple streams over a single connection. QUIC natively supports multiplexing.

### Syscall

System call to the kernel. Expensive due to context switch. io_uring reduces syscalls.

### Tail Latency

Latency at high percentiles (p99, p99.9). Often more important than average latency for user experience.
