- Integration with media pipelines (FFmpeg, GStreamer)
- Low-latency streaming (< 1 second glass-to-glass)

**Timeline**: Q1 2025

**Use cases**: Live streaming, video conferencing, gaming

### Connection Migration

Complete QUIC connection migration support.

**Current**: Basic CID management implemented

**Planned**:
- Active path validation

**Current**: Partial implementation

**Planned**:
- Send/receive datagram API
- Flow control integration
- Application-level datagram framing

**Timeline**: Q1 2025

**Use cases**: Gaming, VoIP, real-time telemetry

### Advanced Congestion Control

Pluggable congestion control with BBR and custom algorithms.

**Current**: CUBIC only

**Planned**:
- BBR v2 implementation
- Pluggable congestion control API
- Per-application congestion control selection
- Congestion control tuning UI

**Timeline**: Q2-Q3 2025

### WebTransport

WebTransport server for browser clients.

**Planned**:
- WebTransport protocol implementation
- Browser-compatible API
- Certificate management for dev/prod
- Integration with existing HTTP/3 server

**Timeline**: Q3 2025

**Use cases**: Browser-based applications, WebRTC alternatives

### Performance Optimizations

Continuous performance improvements.

**Planned**:
- DPDK integration for kernel bypass
- Hardware offload (crypto, checksumming)
- Improved memory allocator
- Better cache locality
- Profile-guided optimization (PGO)

**Timeline**: Ongoing

**Targets**: 40+ Gbps per instance, < 10μs tail latency

### Enhanced Observability

Extended telemetry and debugging capabilities.

**Planned**:
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- eBPF-based profiling integration
- Per-connection performance metrics
- Live debugging interface
- Performance regression detection

**Timeline**: Q2-Q3 2025

## Long-Term (12+ Months)

### Multi-Protocol Support

Unified server for multiple protocols.

**Planned**:
- HTTP/2 over QUIC
- DNS over QUIC (DoQ)
- RTP over QUIC
- Custom protocol templates
- Protocol negotiation framework

**Timeline**: 2026

### Load Balancing & Clustering

Native load balancing and clustering support.

**Planned**:
- Connection migration for load balancing
- Consistent hashing for routing
- Health checking and failover
- State synchronization
- Anycast support

**Timeline**: 2026

### Security Enhancements

Advanced security features.

**Planned**:
- Post-quantum cryptography
- Certificate transparency
- Advanced DDoS mitigation

## Versioning

QuicD follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- **Major (1.0.0)**: Breaking API changes
- **Minor (0.x.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (0.0.x)**: Bug fixes

We aim for:
- Minor releases every 3 months
- Patch releases as needed
- Major releases when API is stable (v1.0 planned for 2025)

## Stability Guarantees

### Stable APIs

APIs that won't change without major version bump:

- `QuicAppFactory` trait
- `ConnectionHandle` core methods
- Configuration file format
- QUIC protocol compliance

### Unstable Features

Features that may change in minor versions:

- MOQ implementation (marked experimental)
- Internal APIs (not part of public API)
- Performance tuning parameters
- Telemetry metric names

### Deprecation Policy

- Features marked deprecated in release N
- Deprecated features removed in release N+2
- Minimum 6 months between deprecation and removal
- Clear migration path documented

## Platform Support

### Current Support

- ✅ **Linux 5.1+**: Full support (io_uring required)
- ✅ **x86_64**: Primary platform
- ✅ **ARM64**: Tested and supported

### Planned Support

- 🚧 **macOS**: Planned (will use kqueue instead of io_uring)
- 🚧 **Windows**: Under consideration (io_uring alternative needed)
- 🚧 **FreeBSD**: Community request

### Architecture Support

- ✅ **x86_64**: Fully tested
- ✅ **ARM64**: Supported and tested
- 🔄 **RISC-V**: Experimental

## Release Cadence
