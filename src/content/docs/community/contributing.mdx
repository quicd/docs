---

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quicd.git
cd quicd

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gh-abhay/quicd.git

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### 2. Find Something to Work On

- Browse [open issues](https://github.com/gh-abhay/quicd/issues)
- Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`
- Check the [roadmap](/community/roadmap/) for planned features
- Propose your own ideas in discussions

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-123
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

QuicD follows standard Rust conventions:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check for common mistakes
cargo clippy

# Run all checks
cargo fmt -- --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add doc comments (`///`) to public APIs
- Follow existing code patterns
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

All new code should include tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for specific crate
cargo test -p quicd-h3

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

**Test Guidelines:**
- Unit tests in same file as code (in `#[cfg(test)]` module)
- Integration tests in `tests/` directory
- Benchmark tests in `benches/` directory
- Test both success and failure cases

### Documentation

Update documentation for any API changes:

```rust
/// Opens a new bidirectional stream.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns the request ID which will be used to correlate the response.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `ConnectionError::Closed` if the worker thread is unavailable.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// let request_id = handle.open_bi()?;
/// ```
pub fn open_bi(&self) -> Result<u64, ConnectionError> {
    // ...
}
```

Generate and preview docs:

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for HTTP/3 server push"
git commit -m "fix: resolve connection leak in worker shutdown"
git commit -m "docs: clarify ALPN negotiation in README"
```

**Commit message format:**
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `test:` Adding tests
- `refactor:` Code change without feature/bug fix
- `perf:` Performance improvement
- `chore:` Build/tooling changes

### 2. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
```

### 3. Create Pull Request

- Go to [github.com/gh-abhay/quicd](https://github.com/gh-abhay/quicd)
- Click "New Pull Request"
- Select your branch
- Fill out the PR template:
  - **Description**: What does this PR do?
  - **Related Issues**: Link to issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
  - **Testing**: How did you test this?
  - **Breaking Changes**: Any API changes?

### 4. Code Review

- Maintainers will review your code
- Address feedback by pushing new commits
- CI checks must pass (tests, linting, formatting)
- Approval from at least one maintainer required

### 5. Merge

Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR. Thank you!

## Coding Standards

### Rust Best Practices

- **Prefer composition over inheritance** (use traits)
- **Use the type system** (make invalid states unrepresentable)
- **Avoid `unwrap()` in library code** (use proper error handling)
- **Use `#[must_use]`** for important return values
- **Avoid allocations in hot paths** (use buffer pools, zero-copy patterns)

### Performance Considerations

- **Profile before optimizing**: Use `cargo bench` and profiling tools
- **Avoid premature optimization**: Clarity first, then optimize
- **Document performance invariants**: Note O(n) complexity, allocation behavior
- **Benchmark critical paths**: Add benchmark tests for hot code

### Error Handling

```rust
// Good: Descriptive error messages
return Err(ConnectionError::Closed(
    format!("worker {} unavailable or overloaded", worker_id)
));

// Bad: Generic error
return Err(ConnectionError::Closed("error".into()));
```

### Unsafe Code

Use `unsafe` sparingly and document invariants:

```rust
/// SAFETY: `ptr` is guaranteed to be valid for `len` bytes because
/// it was allocated from our buffer pool which pre-allocates aligned
/// memory blocks of size 2048 bytes.
unsafe {
    std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(src, ptr, len);
}
```
